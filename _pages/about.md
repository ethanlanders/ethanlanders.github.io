Hi, I'm Ethan! I'm a computer science graduate student at [Old Dominion University](https://odu.edu/), expecting to graduate by May 2025. I'm passionate about solving complex problems, building data-driven solutions, leadership, and fostering collaborative tech communities. I bring a diverse and adaptable skill set to every project. I also speak Spanish conversationally being self-taught.

I'm seeking opportunities in tech where I can leverage my skills in Python, C++, and data visualization.

I also organize the [Tech Alliance of SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/techallianceswfl/){:target="_blank"}, a collective of technology groups and industry leaders dedicated to fostering innovation, promoting technology education, and driving the growth of technology in Southwest Florida. The Tech Alliance has over 700 members individually and 2,000 members collectively. A notable achievement of mine was facilitating a partnership with [Grammerhub](https://grammerhub.org/){:target="_blank"}, a Miami-based tech community, to revamp the Tech Alliance's website. This project improved the websiteâ€™s functionality and accessibility while providing emerging developers with opportunities to contribute to a nonprofit open-source initiative. It also bridged two tech communities, fostering skill development and expanding outreach.

I'm excited to bring my technical expertise, leadership experience, and collaborative mindset to my next opportunity in tech.
