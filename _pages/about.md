Hi, I'm Ethan! I'm a computer science graduate student at [Old Dominion University](https://odu.edu/), expecting to graduate by Spring 2025. I'm passionate about solving complex problems, building data-driven solutions, leadership, and fostering collaborative tech communities. I bring a diverse and adaptable skill set to every project. I also speak Spanish conversationally being self-taught.

I'm seeking opportunities in tech where I can leverage my skills in Python, C++, and data visualization.

I organize two tech Meetup groups based in Southwest Florida:

* **[Tech Alliance of SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/techallianceswfl/){:target="_blank"}**
  - A collective of technology groups and industry leaders dedicated to fostering innovation, promoting technology education, and driving the growth of technology in Southwest Florida.
  - Over 700 members individually and 2,000 members collectively.
  - A notable achievement was facilitating a partnership with [Grammerhub](https://grammerhub.org/){:target="_blank"}, a Miami-based tech community, to revamp the Tech Alliance's website. This project improved the websiteâ€™s functionality and accessibility while providing emerging developers with opportunities to contribute to a nonprofit open-source initiative. It also bridged two tech communities, fostering skill development and expanding outreach.

* **[Python SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/pythonswfl/){:target="_blank"}**
  - Volunteer-run interdisciplinary user group based in Southwest Florida dedicated to exploration and experimentation with the Python programming language.
  - Over 350 members.
  - I've hosted workshops covering Python fundamentals, organized in-person networking events, and supported various initiatives to promote technology education.

I'm excited to bring my technical expertise, leadership experience, and collaborative mindset to my next opportunity in tech.
