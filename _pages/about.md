Hi, I'm Ethan! I'm an [Old Dominion University](https://odu.edu/) computer science graduate student expecting to graduate by Spring 2025. I am passionate about technology, music, [photography](https://ethanlandersphoto.myportfolio.com/), building communities, and foreign languages. I speak Spanish conversationally, I am self-taught.

I am also an organizer for two large tech Meetup groups based in Southwest Florida:
* **[Tech Alliance of SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/techallianceswfl/)**
  - A collective of technology groups and industry leaders dedicated to fostering innovation, promoting technology education, and driving the growth of technology in Southwest Florida.
  - Over 700 members itself and 2000 members combined between all member groups.
* **[Python SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/pythonswfl/)**
  - Volunteer-run interdisciplinary user group based in Southwest Florida dedicated to exploration and experimentation with the Python programming language.
