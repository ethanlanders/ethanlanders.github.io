Hi, I'm Ethan -- a Computer Science graduate student at [Old Dominion University](https://odu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, graduating in August 2025. I specialize in data analytics, visualization, and problem-solving at the intersection of technology and real-world impact.

This summer, I am working as a Business Analytics Intern at [Chartway Credit Union](https://www.chartway.com/){:target="_blank"} in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where I analyze real estate data using SQL and Power BI to drive business insights and inform decision-making. My recent projects include building an interactive dashboard to visualize the effects of medical breakthroughs on 20th-century U.S. mortality trends, and analyzing Netflix film data to explore viewing patterns.

I am particularly interested in opportunities where I can apply my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling to uncover meaningful insights and improve systems. I work comfortably across tools like Python, JavaScript, D3.js, SQL, and Power BI.

Outside of the classroom and workplace, I lead the [Tech Alliance of SWFL](https://www.techallianceswfl.org/){:target="_blank"}, a community of 2,000+ tech professionals and learners. I organize meetups, Python workshops, and open-source projects, including a cross-city partnership with [Grammerhub](https://grammerhub.org/){:target="_blank"} to redesign our website and connect developers with real project experience.

I speak conversational Spanish and care deeply about cross-cultural collaboration, community building, and continual learning. I am always looking for opportunities to grow, contribute, and connect.
