My name is Ethan Landers. I'm an [Old Dominion University](https://odu.edu/) graduate student pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science, where I expect to graduate by Spring 2025. I am passionate about technology, music, [photography](https://ethanlandersphoto.myportfolio.com/), building communities, and foreign languages. I am bilingual with Spanish, self-taught!

I am an organizer for two large tech Meetup groups based in Southwest Florida:
* [Python SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/pythonswfl/)
  - Volunteer-run interdisciplinary user group based in Southwest Florida dedicated to exploration and experimentation with the Python programming language.
  - Over 350 members.
* [Tech Alliance of SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/techallianceswfl/)
  - A collective of technology groups and industry leaders dedicated to fostering innovation, promoting technology education, and driving the growth of technology in Southwest Florida.
  - Over 700 members itself and 2000 members combined between all member groups.
